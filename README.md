# Codecrafters Labs Web Development Mentoring Program

Welcome to the **Codecrafters Labs Web Development Mentoring Program**! This repository is exclusively for the selected mentees who will have the opportunity to prove their problem-solving skills and coding abilities by completing four Codewars challenges.

## How It Works
As the initial step to enter this mentoring program, you are required to solve the following four Codewars challenges:

1. **[[Training JS #1 Create your first function](https://www.codewars.com/kata/571ec274b1c8d4a61c0000c8)]**
2. **[[Training #6 basic data-types and conditional statements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/571f832f07363d295d001ba8/javascript)]**
3. **[[Even or Odd](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe)]**
4. **[[Simple Calculator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57158fb92ad763bb180004e7/javascript)]**

These challenges are carefully selected to assess your logical thinking, algorithmic skills, and problem-solving approach. Completing them will demonstrate your readiness to join this batch of mentees.

## Why This Matters
Solving these challenges will help us evaluate your:
- **Logical Thinking** â€“ Your ability to break down complex problems.
- **Code Quality** â€“ Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- **Problem-Solving Approach** â€“ How you tackle coding problems with structured thinking.

Only those who successfully complete all four challenges will be considered for this batch.

## Important Guidelines
ðŸš¨ **Do Not Use AI to Solve the Challenges** ðŸš¨
We strongly encourage you to **solve these challenges on your own**. The purpose of this process is to enhance your coding skills, and relying on AI-generated solutions will not help you grow as a developer. Instead, take your time to analyze the problems, experiment with solutions, and refine your approach.

If you get stuck, feel free to discuss with fellow mentees or ask for hints, but make sure that you **write the code yourself**.
